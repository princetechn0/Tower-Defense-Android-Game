# Tower Defense Game for Android

Space Tower Defense is a tower defense mobile game for Android. 

The essence of the game is to protect your Space Station from waves of oncoming enemies through the use of three towers. By doing so, you must strategically plan how to diversify your resources in order to ensure the most plausible configuration.

Upon entering the application, on screen messages aid the user in how to interact with the application. As users experiment by clicking certain buttons, they will notice more menus and on screen messages that guide them in how to play. For example, when the user clicks on one of the three towers in the top right, they notice a new menu that displays the cost of the tower and its type. However, if they decide they would like a different tower, they can easily click on another to display its information.

When the user decides to purchase a tower, the map conveniently displays a “red zone” where the user is not allowed to place the newly purchased tower. This prevents the user from obfuscating the path with enemies, ruining the overall experience. For new users, a convenient on screen message is displayed to inform them of what is happening.

With towers placed on the map, selling them is convenient as ever! Simply click on any tower, and the corresponding tower is highlighted, portraying its firing radius, other info, and most importantly, the ability to sell it back.

As for gameplay, the levels begin with one enemy type, then begin to diversify the types as the levels go by. This is done to ease the user into the game without overwhelming them with a barrage of enemies from the get-go. Enemies move along their path and are only targeted by the towers when within their radius. Enemies’ goal is to reach the Space Station, in which depending on their type, they possess different damage to the Station. Here are the three types:

As enemies begin to populate the screen, they are met with the challenge of avoiding the towers’ shots to exterminate them. Their chances are not too bad; each tower has a cooldown period, in which the tower cannot fire. However, if the enemy is struck by the towers’ shot, a particle explosion takes place. Audio is also available when an enemy dies or the tower fires a shot.

As the enemies reach the Station, they start to damage it. This damage becomes evident quite quickly, with big X’s appearing on the Station with certain health levels.

Eventually, the Station runs out of health, and here we see the “Game Over” screen, with a new image for the tower as well. This also shows the total number of enemies killed by the player.

That's the gist of my game! I had a great time building it and learned a lot about myself and programming.
